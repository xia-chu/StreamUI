  <h1>StreamUI</h1>
</div>

A minimalist and lightweight video streaming management platform — out of the box and easy to extend.

> In StreamUI, “Stream” comes from the stream concept in [ZLMediaKit](https://github.com/ZLMediaKit/ZLMediaKit), and “UI” comes from [Layui](https://github.com/layui/layui). The overall design uses blue-green (`#16baaa`) as the primary color and follows the principles of “simple, easy to use, and extensible”. We continuously balance code complexity and feature implementation, and keep pursuing the beauty of minimalism.

### Features

✅ Supports pull-proxy ingestion and saving for mainstream protocols such as RTSP/RTMP/HLS/WebRTC/RTP/GB28181.

✅ Supports push ingestion for protocols such as RTSP/RTMP/RTP.

✅ Supports stream distribution via RTSP/WebRTC/RTMP/FLV/HLS/HLS-fMP4/HTTP-TS/HTTP-fMP4 and more.

✅ Supports 1x1, 2x2, 3x3 multi-screen playback.

✅ Supports local recording, playback, download, automatic cleanup, and more.

StreamUI focuses on stream management. It currently does not support ONVIF/GB28181 device discovery, stream ingestion, or PTZ control.

### Quick Start

This project is recommended to be deployed with Docker Compose.

```shell
cd ./docker
docker compose up -d
```

After it starts, open `http://{your server IP}:10800` in your browser and log in.

The default password is `streamui`. You can change it in [login.html](./frontend/login.html).

### Tips

After the first startup, it’s recommended to go to the [Basic Settings] page first and adjust the configuration as needed.

- Consider enabling on-demand forwarding: saves bandwidth, but the first viewer may need to wait for the forwarded stream to start.
- Consider disabling protocols you don’t need to forward. For example, if you don’t need RTMP distribution, disable RTMP forwarding.
- Consider enabling faststart: allows fast seeking during playback, but consumes a bit more storage during recording.
- Consider increasing the GOP cache: smoother playback and longer event video backtracking time, but increases memory usage.

### Architecture

StreamUI is designed for minimal implementation. The frontend does not use heavy frameworks such as Vue or React, and the backend avoids complex Java Spring ecosystems, choosing a lightweight combination of Layui and FastAPI. The overall architecture is clean and easy to understand for secondary development.

Project structure:

```bash

You can add new features or modify existing ones based on StreamUI, such as ONVIF/GB28181 device discovery, stream ingestion, PTZ control, etc.
